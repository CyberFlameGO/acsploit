ACsploit is a command-line utility that generates worst-case inputs to commonly used algorithms. Many widely-used algorithms for graph operations, string comparisons, sorting, and other such common tasks work well on most inputs but run very poorly on certain classes of unusual inputs. ACsploit generates crafted inputs that target these worst-cases, inducing high resource (ie time and/or space) consumption in the target. Originally developed for the DARPA STAC program, ACsploit has been expanded and extended to be a powerful tool in any vulnerability researcher or exploit developer's toolkit.

ACsploit is modular and highly configurable, supporting a wide variety of user-specified constraints on the generated output (so as to fit the requirements of the application under test) and an equally wide array of output formats and mechanisms to assist the user in taking the exploit from ACsploit to the target. ACsploit supports both script-driven and interactive use through a familiar Metasploit-like interface.

ACsploit comes with exploits for 30+ algorithms and is easily extensible. ACsploit is designed to allow members of the community to contribute new exploit modules, input generators, and output formatters to expand upon all aspects of its functionality.
