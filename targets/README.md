# Sample Targets

This folder contains simple targets for experimenting with ACsploit. These programs minimally implement various algorithms and provide basic statistics to demonstrate that the outputs generated by ACsploit's exploits produce worst-case effects.

All programs that take files as inputs read the file format produced by ACsploit's `file` output with default options.

The following programs are included:

### BoyerMoore.java (`strings/matching/boyer_moore`)
Implements the [Boyer-Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer–Moore_string-search_algorithm) string matching algorithm.

```
javac BoyerMoore.java
java BoyerMoore NEEDLE HAYSTACK
```

### bsd.py (`hash/collisions/bsd`)
Implements a [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) with 10 buckets using the [BSD algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_checksum) and separate chaining. The hash table only supports insertions, as the exploit in ACsploit aims to maximize insertion time per item.

```
python bsd.py STR [STR…]
```

### jarvis_march.py (`geometry/convex_hull`)
Implements the [Jarvis March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm) algorithm for finding the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) of a set of 2D points.

```
python jarvis_march.py POINTS_FILE
```

### kruskal.py (`graphs/min_span_tree/kruskal`)
Implements [Kruskal's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm) algorithm for finding the [minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) of a graph

```
python kruskal.py GRAPH_FILE
```


### MergeSort.java (`sort/mergesort`)
Implements the [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) sorting algorithm.

```
javac MergeSort.java
java MergeSort INT [INT…]
```

### red_black_tree.py (`tree/red_black_tree`)
Implements a [Red-black tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red–black_tree). The tree only supports insertions, as the exploit in ACsploit aims to maximize insertion time per item.

```
python red_black_tree.py INT [INT…]
```

### zxcvbn (`passwords/zxcvbn`)
Implements the [zxcvbn]() password strength checking algorithm.

```
./zxcvbn PASSWORD
```
