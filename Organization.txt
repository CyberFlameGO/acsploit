To get readable list of all classes in python:
for pair in inspect.getmembers(sys.modules[__name__], inspect.isclass):
    print(pair[0])

Currently, each of the following are contained within the Algorithms module without much structure. Ideally, they would be organized so that the user wouldn't have to know every algorithm in order to select it. One solution would just be printing the structure and names of algorithms to the console, but that might not be great as more algorithms are added.

Potential organization:

String comparison algorithms
    BoyerMoore
    RabinKarp

Graph algorithms
    BFS
    DFS
    BellmanFord
    Dijkstra
    Fleury
    FloydWarshall
    Hierholzer
    Johnson
    TopologicalSort

Maximum flow algorithms
    Dinic
    EdmondsKarp
    FordFulkerson
    PushRelabel

Minimum spanning tree algorithms
    Kruskal
    Prim

Geometric algorithms
    Graham
    Jarvis

Data structures
    BinaryHeap
    BinomialHeap
    FibonacciHeap
    Hashmap
    PriorityQueue
    (Trees)
        AVLTree
        BTree
        BinarySearchTree
        RedBlackTree
    Trie
