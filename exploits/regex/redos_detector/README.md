ReDoS Detector
==============

Currently a work in progress. Eventually will be added to *ACsploit*. As of now, it can only the following:


  * Grouping (use of `(` and `)`)
  * One-or-more qualifier (use of `+`)
  * Zero-or-one qualifier (use of `?`)
  * Zero-or-more qualifier (use of `*`)
  * Alternation (use of `|`)
  * Any char (use of `.`)
  * Escaping any of the above with `\`
  
**Note:** This project is intended to be Python 3 compatible, for easy integration into *ACsploit*.


Basic approach
--------------

  1. Convert regex to an NFA graph (**in progress**)
  2. Apply various heuristics and algorithms to the NFA graph to detect ReDoS vulnerability (**to-do**)
  3. If vulnerable, output a string to "exploit" the ReDoS vulnerability (**to-do**)
  
Usage
-----

**Note:** This is a work in progress. The information in this section may be out of date and is subject to change.

The `redos_detector` tool takes the following arguments:

  * `-r` *REGEX* (the regex provided by the user)
  * `-e` (flag that indicates whether an exploit string is desired, if *REGEX* is vulnerable)
  * `-d` (flag that indicates debug mode, in which the parsed NFA graph is displayed)

At the time of this writing, `-e` does nothing, `-d` is functional, and `-r` handles a limited amount of regex syntax (see above).

**Example usage:** `python3 redos_detector.py -d -r "he(ll)+(o|p_me+)"`
